\title{Sampled SVC Data}
\format{
A `list` with the following entries:
\describe{
  \item{y}{(\code{numeric}) Response}
  \item{X}{(\code{numeric}) Covariates; first columns contains ones to model
  an intercept, the second column contains standard-normal sampled data.}
  \item{beta}{(\code{numeric}) The sampled Gaussian processes, which are
  usually unobserved. It uses a Matern covariance function and the true 
  parameters are given in the entry `true_pars`.}
  \item{eps}{(\code{numeric}) Error (or Nugget effect), i.e., drawn from a 
  zero-mean normal distribution with 0.5 standard deviation.}
  \item{locs}{(\code{numeric}) Locations sampled from a uniform distribution
  on the interval 0 to 10.}
  \item{true_pars}{(\code{data.frame}) True parameters of the GP-based SVC 
  model with Gaussian process mean, variance, and range. Additionally, the 
  smoothness (nu) is given.}

SVCdata

\description{
A list object that contains sampled data of 500 observations. The data has 
been sampled using the `RandomFields` package. It is given in the list object 
\code{SVCdata} which contains the following.
