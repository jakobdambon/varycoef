    c(person(given = "Jakob",

             role = c("aut", "cre"),

Description: Gives maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) method to
    estimate and predict spatially varying coefficient (SVC) Models. It
    supports covariance tapering by Furrer et al. (2006)
    <doi:10.1198/106186006X132178> to allow MLE on large data.
